# Pandas Data Analysis Project

This project demonstrates how to use [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) — a powerful Python library for data manipulation and analysis. It includes various data cleaning, transformation, and analysis techniques commonly used in data science workflows.

## 📦 Features

- Import and export datasets (CSV, Excel, JSON, etc.)
- Data cleaning (missing values, duplicates, data types)
- Data transformation (filtering, grouping, merging, reshaping)
- Descriptive statistics and aggregations
- Time series analysis
- Data visualization using Pandas and Matplotlib/Seaborn

## 🛠 Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib (optional, for visualization)
- seaborn (optional, for enhanced visualizations)
  
Install dependencies via pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
````

Or individually:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
```

## 🚀 Usage

You can start by exploring the sample notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook notebooks/analysis.ipynb
```

Or run the scripts directly:

```bash
python scripts/clean_data.py
```

## 📊 Example Code Snippet

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load a dataset
df = pd.read_csv("data/sample.csv")

# Clean missing values
df.dropna(inplace=True)

# Basic statistics
print(df.describe())

# Group by category
grouped = df.groupby("category")["sales"].sum()
print(grouped)
```

If you're building something specific (e.g. time series forecasting, EDA on a large dataset, etc.), let me know and I can tailor this README to that.
